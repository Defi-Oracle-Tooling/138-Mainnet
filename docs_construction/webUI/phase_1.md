3. Logic Mappings & Decision Trees

Boolean Logic Operators

The tool supports advanced logical operators that allow users to combine conditions:
	•	AND (&): All specified conditions must be met.
	•	OR (|): At least one of the specified conditions must be met.
	•	NAND (!&): Not all specified conditions are allowed to be true simultaneously.
	•	NOR (!|): None of the specified conditions can be true.

Example Boolean Expression:

deployment_logic:
  condition: "(Cloud | Multi-Cloud) & Kubernetes & (! Hybrid)"

This expression requires that the deployment be either Cloud or Multi-Cloud, must include Kubernetes, and must not be Hybrid.

Advanced Conditional Rules and Dependencies
	•	Context-Aware Filtering:
	•	Example: If “Deploy on Kubernetes” is selected, additional questions on Kubernetes version and RBAC policies are prompted.
	•	Dynamic Question Mapping:
	•	Advanced options are available via an “[Advanced]” toggle, allowing the user to specify extra details (e.g., custom region rules, node performance tuning).

Example Decision Trees

Deployment Environment Tree:
	1.	Select Environment:
	•	Options: Development, Testing, Production
	•	[Advanced]: Custom environment name and compliance settings.
	2.	Select Deployment Model:
	•	Options: Local, Cloud, Multi-Cloud, Hybrid
	•	[Advanced]: Specify cloud providers, inter-region networking, failover strategy.
	3.	Containerization:
	•	Docker: Yes/No with advanced configuration (base image, runtime, security).
	•	Kubernetes: Yes/No with version and policy settings.
