-->

Below is the complete plan for Phase 2, which builds on the foundation of Phase 1. This phase focuses on developing a fully interactive Web UI that integrates with the backend API, enabling live configuration previews, AI-based cost estimation, dynamic rule building (including AND/OR/NAND/NOR logic), and one-click deployment automation using Terraform/Ansible and Kubernetes. The following sections detail the system architecture, implementation steps, code samples, and integration points.

Phase 2: Web UI Development & Deployment Automation

Overview

Phase 2 will provide a user-friendly, browser-based interface that allows users to:
	â€¢	Interactively select and configure deployment options.
	â€¢	Visualize configuration details in real time.
	â€¢	Drag and drop logic rules for advanced conditions.
	â€¢	Receive AI-driven recommendations and cost/risk analysis.
	â€¢	Generate and deploy infrastructure automatically via Terraform, Kubernetes, and Ansible.

1. System Architecture

Frontend (React + TailwindCSS)
	â€¢	UI Components:
	â€¢	Multi-step Configuration Wizard: Guides users through environment, deployment, blockchain, and security options.
	â€¢	Drag-and-Drop Logic Builder: Enables users to specify Boolean logic (AND/OR/NAND/NOR) visually.
	â€¢	Live Preview Panel: Dynamically displays the current configuration in JSON/YAML format.
	â€¢	Real-Time Cost & Risk Metrics: AI estimates and displays potential costs and security risk scores.

Backend (Node.js + Express)
	â€¢	RESTful API Endpoints:
	â€¢	Save Configuration: Accepts configuration data from the frontend and stores it in a database.
	â€¢	Generate IaC Templates: Uses stored configurations to generate Terraform and Kubernetes manifest files.
	â€¢	Trigger Deployment: Initiates automated deployment using Terraform/Ansible commands.
	â€¢	Integration with AI Modules:
	â€¢	Provides recommendations, cost estimation, and risk analysis based on user selections.

Infrastructure & CI/CD
	â€¢	Terraform & Ansible: Automatically generate and apply infrastructure-as-code templates.
	â€¢	CI/CD Pipelines: Enable continuous testing, integration, and deployment (using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI/CD).

2. Implementation Plan

Step 1: Develop the Frontend

A. React-Based Configuration UI
	â€¢	Multi-Step Form: Implement separate steps for environment selection, deployment type, blockchain options, security, and advanced settings.
	â€¢	Drag-and-Drop Rule Builder: Use libraries like React DnD or a dedicated UI kit to let users create logical expressions.
	â€¢	Live Preview: Use state management (via React Context or Redux) to update a preview pane in real time.

Example React Component:

import React, { useState } from "react";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Card, CardContent } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { motion } from "framer-motion";

export default function Configurator() {
  const [deployment, setDeployment] = useState({
    environment: "",
    deploymentType: "",
    cloudProvider: [],
    blockchainProtocols: [],
    securityMeasures: [],
    advancedRules: "",
    aiRecommendations: {},
  });

  const handleSelection = (category, value) => {
    setDeployment((prev) => ({
      ...prev,
      [category]: Array.isArray(prev[category])
        ? [...prev[category], value]
        : value,
    }));
  };

  const handleAdvancedRules = (rule) => {
    setDeployment((prev) => ({
      ...prev,
      advancedRules: rule,
    }));
  };

  return (
    <div className="p-6">
      <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">ðŸš€ Deployment Configuration</h1>

      {/* Environment Selection */}
      <Card className="mt-4">
        <CardContent>
          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">Select Environment</h2>
          <Button onClick={() => handleSelection("environment", "Production")}>
            Production
          </Button>
          <Button onClick={() => handleSelection("environment", "Testing")}>
            Testing
          </Button>
          <Button onClick={() => handleSelection("environment", "Development")}>
            Development
          </Button>
        </CardContent>
      </Card>

      {/* Cloud Provider Selection */}
      <Card className="mt-4">
        <CardContent>
          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">Select Cloud Provider</h2>
          <Button onClick={() => handleSelection("cloudProvider", "AWS")}>
            AWS
          </Button>
          <Button onClick={() => handleSelection("cloudProvider", "Azure")}>
            Azure
          </Button>
          <Button onClick={() => handleSelection("cloudProvider", "GCP")}>
            GCP
          </Button>
        </CardContent>
      </Card>

      {/* Drag-and-Drop Logic Builder (Placeholder) */}
      <Card className="mt-4">
        <CardContent>
          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">Advanced Rule Builder</h2>
          <input
            type="text"
            placeholder='e.g., "(Cloud | Multi-Cloud) & Kubernetes & (! Hybrid)"'
            className="p-2 border rounded w-full"
            onChange={(e) => handleAdvancedRules(e.target.value)}
          />
        </CardContent>
      </Card>

      {/* Live Preview */}
      <div className="mt-6">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">Deployment Preview</h2>
        <motion.div animate={{ opacity: 1 }} initial={{ opacity: 0 }}>
          <pre className="bg-gray-900 text-white p-4 rounded-lg">
            {JSON.stringify(deployment, null, 2)}
          </pre>
        </motion.div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

B. Real-Time Cost & Risk Dashboard
	â€¢	Integrate a dedicated panel that shows AI-driven cost estimation and risk scores.
	â€¢	Use API calls to retrieve real-time metrics from the backend.

Step 2: Build the Backend API

A. API Endpoints Using Node.js + Express
	â€¢	Endpoint to Save Configuration:
Accepts JSON data and stores it in the database.
	â€¢	Endpoint to Generate IaC Templates:
Based on configuration, generates Terraform/Kubernetes manifests.
	â€¢	Endpoint to Trigger Deployment:
Executes shell commands (e.g., running Terraform) and returns deployment logs.

Example Node.js API:

const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const cors = require("cors");
const fs = require("fs");
const { exec } = require("child_process");

const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(cors());

let configurations = [];

// Save configuration and generate Terraform template
app.post("/save-config", (req, res) => {
  const config = req.body;
  configurations.push(config);

  // Example: Generate a simple Terraform file based on the cloud provider selection
  const terraformConfig = `
provider "${config.cloudProvider[0]}" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "server" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t3.medium"
}`;

  fs.writeFileSync("terraform.tf", terraformConfig);
  res.json({ message: "Configuration saved and Terraform template generated!" });
});

// Get all configurations
app.get("/configurations", (req, res) => {
  res.json(configurations);
});

// Trigger deployment via Terraform
app.post("/deploy", (req, res) => {
  exec("terraform init && terraform apply -auto-approve", (err, stdout, stderr) => {
    if (err) {
      res.status(500).json({ error: stderr });
    } else {
      res.json({ message: "Deployment successful!", output: stdout });
    }
  });
});

app.listen(4000, () => {
  console.log("API running on port 4000");
});

B. Integration with AI Modules
	â€¢	Expose endpoints that provide AI recommendations based on input data.
	â€¢	Example endpoint could run the Python AI engine and return suggestions for cost optimization and risk mitigation.

Step 3: CI/CD & Automated Deployment

A. Terraform & Ansible Integration
	â€¢	Terraform Templates: Automatically generated based on user configuration.
	â€¢	Ansible Playbooks: For post-deployment configuration management.
	â€¢	Deployment Trigger: API endpoint to run Terraform commands using Node.js exec.

B. CI/CD Pipeline Example
	â€¢	GitHub Actions or Jenkins Pipeline:
	â€¢	Run tests against the configuration.
	â€¢	Execute Terraform initialization and apply.
	â€¢	Rollback on failure based on defined rules.

Sample GitHub Actions YAML:

name: Deploy Config Tool

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Terraform
        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1

      - name: Terraform Init
        run: terraform init

      - name: Terraform Apply
        run: terraform apply -auto-approve

3. Integration Points & Testing

A. Frontend & Backend Communication
	â€¢	Use RESTful API calls (via Axios or Fetch) in React to send configuration data to the backend.
	â€¢	Ensure proper CORS settings and error handling on both ends.

B. End-to-End Testing
	â€¢	Write integration tests to simulate user flows from configuration selection to deployment.
	â€¢	Validate that Terraform templates are generated correctly and deployments execute as expected.

C. Security & Compliance
	â€¢	Ensure API endpoints are secured with proper authentication (e.g., JWT tokens).
	â€¢	Implement role-based access in both frontend and backend.
	â€¢	Integrate automated compliance checks into the deployment pipeline.

4. Roadmap & Future Enhancements

Immediate Next Steps:
	1.	Complete the React UI:
	â€¢	Refine the multi-step configuration wizard.
	â€¢	Enhance the drag-and-drop logic builder with additional UI/UX improvements.
	2.	Develop Full Backend API:
	â€¢	Finalize all endpoints, ensuring robust error handling.
	â€¢	Integrate AI modules for real-time cost estimation and risk analysis.
	3.	Integrate Terraform/Ansible Deployment:

	â€¢	Implement CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration and deployment.
	4.	User Testing & Feedback:
	â€¢	Conduct user sessions to refine UI/UX.
	â€¢	Gather feedback on AI recommendations and cost/risk estimations.

Future Enhancements:
	â€¢	Enhanced AI Models: Improve accuracy of cost predictions and risk scores using historical data.
	â€¢	Expanded Cloud & Blockchain Support: Integrate additional cloud providers and blockchain networks.
	â€¢	Advanced Security Modules: Implement blockchain-based audit logging and real-time compliance monitoring.
	â€¢	Web UI Enhancements: Add features such as real-time collaboration and a more sophisticated drag-and-drop logic builder.

Conclusion & Next Steps

Phase 2 focuses on building a robust, interactive Web UI that ties together all the components developed in Phase 1. By following this plan, we can deliver a fully integrated system that empowers users to configure, preview, and deploy complex multi-cloud and blockchain environments with AI-driven optimizations and real-time insights.

Next Action:
Proceed with implementing the frontend components (React UI) alongside the backend API integration. Once a basic working prototype is available, conduct end-to-end tests and refine the user experience before moving on to advanced features and broader integrations.
