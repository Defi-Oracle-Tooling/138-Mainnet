Below is a detailed guide to setting up your development environment and initializing your version control repository. This guide covers all necessary prerequisites, repository structure, and configuration steps to get your project up and running.

1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:
	•	Node.js & npm (version 14+ recommended)
	•	Python 3.x (for AI modules and CLI tools)
	•	Git (for version control)
	•	Docker (optional – for containerized development)
	•	An IDE/Text Editor (VSCode, WebStorm, etc.)

2. Repository Initialization & Version Control Setup

A. Create the Repository
	1.	On GitHub (or your chosen platform):
	•	Log in and create a new repository (e.g., config-tool).
	•	Choose to initialize the repository without a README if you plan to add your own.
	2.	Clone the Repository Locally:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/config-tool.git
cd config-tool



B. Initialize Git (if not already done)

If you’re starting in a local folder:

git init

C. Create a .gitignore File

Create a .gitignore file to exclude common files and directories. For example:

# Node.js dependencies
/node_modules
/dist

# Python artifacts
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd
env/
venv/

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Terraform files
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.*
.terraform/

# Environment variables
.env

Save this file in your repository root.

3. Project Structure

Organize your repository into subdirectories for each component of the project. An example structure might be:

config-tool/
├── backend/           # Node.js Express API
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── server.js
│   └── ... 
├── frontend/          # React-based Web UI
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── src/
│   └── public/
├── ai/                # Python AI modules and optimization scripts
│   ├── requirements.txt
│   ├── ai_engine.py
│   └── ...
├── infrastructure/    # Terraform & Ansible templates
│   ├── terraform.tf
│   └── ansible-playbook.yml
├── cli/               # CLI-based configuration generator (Python)
│   ├── config_generator.py
│   └── ...
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
└── docs/              # Documentation files
    └── design_doc.md

This structure separates concerns and makes it easy to manage each component.

4. Installing Dependencies

A. Backend Setup (Node.js)
	1.	Navigate to the backend directory:

cd backend


	2.	Initialize Node.js project (if not already done):

npm init -y


	3.	Install Express and other dependencies:

npm install express body-parser cors


	4.	Create your server file (e.g., server.js) with your API endpoints.

B. Frontend Setup (React)
	1.	Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd ../frontend


	2.	Use Create React App (or your preferred method):

npx create-react-app .


	3.	Install additional libraries like TailwindCSS and Framer Motion:

npm install tailwindcss framer-motion axios


	4.	Set up your project structure within the src folder as needed.

C. AI Module Setup (Python)
	1.	Navigate to the ai directory:

cd ../ai


	2.	Create a virtual environment (recommended):

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


	3.	Create a requirements.txt file listing required packages:

numpy
scikit-learn
pandas


	4.	Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt



D. CLI Tool Setup (Python)

Repeat the Python virtual environment setup if needed (can be combined with the AI module if you prefer).

5. Running the Development Environment

A. Start the Backend Server

From the backend directory:

node server.js

Your Node.js API should now be running on a specified port (e.g., 4000).

B. Start the Frontend

From the frontend directory:

npm start

This should open your React application in the browser (typically at http://localhost:3000).

C. Run Python Modules

Activate your virtual environment and run your Python scripts:

source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
python ai_engine.py       # or your CLI tool: python config_generator.py

6. Setting Up CI/CD (Optional)

Integrate with GitHub Actions or Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment. For example, create a .github/workflows/deploy.yml in your repository root:

name: Deploy Config Tool

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: 14

      - name: Install Backend Dependencies
        working-directory: ./backend
        run: npm install

      - name: Run Backend Tests
        working-directory: ./backend
        run: npm test

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.x

      - name: Install AI Dependencies
        working-directory: ./ai
        run: |
          python -m venv venv
          . venv/bin/activate
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Deploy Infrastructure
        run: |
          cd infrastructure
          terraform init
          terraform apply -auto-approve

This sample workflow checks out your code, installs dependencies, runs tests, and deploys your infrastructure using Terraform.

7. Version Control Best Practices
	•	Branching Strategy:
Use feature branches (e.g., feature/ui-improvements, feature/ai-enhancements) and merge via pull requests after code review.
	•	Commit Messages:
Follow a consistent commit message style (e.g., using Conventional Commits).
	•	Documentation:
Update the README.md and documentation files within the docs/ folder to reflect changes and provide usage instructions.
	•	Regular Backups:
Push your changes to the remote repository frequently to ensure your work is backed up.

8. Next Steps
	1.	Initialize the repository using the structure above.
	2.	Set up your development environment for each component.
	3.	Implement initial prototypes for backend API, frontend UI, and AI modules.
	4.	Integrate CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
	5.	Collaborate with your team by sharing repository access and setting up project management (e.g., GitHub Projects or Jira).

With these steps completed, you’ll have a robust development environment and a well-organized version control repository to support the continued development of the Config Tool.
