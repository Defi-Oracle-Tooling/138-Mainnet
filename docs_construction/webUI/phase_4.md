Milestone 2: Complete React Frontend UI

Duration: 2–3 Weeks

Key Tasks:
	•	Multi-Step Configuration Wizard:
	•	Finalize UI flows for environment, deployment, blockchain, and security selections.
	•	Implement context-aware filtering to dynamically show/hide advanced options.
	•	Drag-and-Drop Logic Builder:
	•	Integrate a visual builder for composing Boolean logic (AND/OR/NAND/NOR).
	•	Ensure real-time validation and feedback.
	•	Live Preview & Dashboard:
	•	Create a live preview panel that updates with the latest configuration in JSON/YAML.
	•	Integrate a cost and risk dashboard that displays AI recommendations.
	•	Backend Integration:
	•	Use Axios or Fetch to connect the UI with the backend API endpoints.
	•	User Testing:
	•	Conduct internal UI tests and iterate based on feedback.

Deliverables:
	•	Complete, interactive React UI with multi-step wizard and visual logic builder.
	•	Live preview panel and integrated cost/risk dashboard.
	•	Stable connection to backend API.

Milestone 3: Infrastructure Deployment Integration

Duration: 2 Weeks

Key Tasks:
	•	Terraform & Ansible Template Generation:
	•	Expand Terraform templates to support multi-cloud scenarios.
	•	Develop Ansible playbooks for post-deployment configuration.
	•	Deployment Trigger:
	•	Integrate a deployment trigger within the backend that calls Terraform and Ansible.
	•	End-to-End Testing:
	•	Validate that configurations from the frontend generate the correct IaC templates.
	•	Test deployment on a staging environment.

Deliverables:
	•	Automated IaC template generation based on user configurations.
	•	End-to-end deployment workflow that has been successfully tested in a staging environment.

Milestone 4: CI/CD Pipeline Setup & Testing

Duration: 1–2 Weeks

Key Tasks:
	•	CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:
	•	Set up pipelines using GitHub Actions (or your chosen tool) for:
	•	Automated testing (frontend, backend, and AI modules).
	•	Deployment of Terraform templates.
	•	Rollback Strategies:
	•	Define and test automated rollback procedures for failed deployments.
	•	Monitoring & Alerts:
	•	Integrate basic monitoring for pipeline failures and deployment issues.

Deliverables:
	•	Fully automated CI/CD pipelines for testing, integration, and deployment.
	•	Documented rollback procedures and monitoring alerts.

Milestone 5: Security, Compliance & Audit Logging

Duration: 1–2 Weeks

Key Tasks:
	•	Access Control & Authentication:
	•	Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and secure authentication (JWT or OAuth).
	•	Compliance Enforcement:
	•	Integrate automated compliance checks (e.g., GDPR, FATF, ISO 27001) into the configuration process.
	•	Audit Logging:
	•	Develop immutable audit logging (optionally using blockchain-based logging) for configuration changes and deployments.
	•	Security Testing:
	•	Conduct security audits and penetration tests on both API and UI.

Deliverables:
	•	Hardened security features with RBAC and proper authentication.
	•	Automated compliance checks and robust audit logging.
	•	Security testing reports and remediation plans.

Milestone 6: User Beta Testing & Feedback Integration

Duration: 2–3 Weeks

Key Tasks:
	•	Beta Testing:
	•	Recruit a group of beta users to test the complete Config Tool (both CLI and Web UI).
	•	Feedback Collection:
	•	Use surveys, direct feedback, and usage analytics to identify issues and areas for improvement.
	•	Iteration:
	•	Prioritize feedback and implement UI/UX refinements, adjust AI recommendations, and fix any integration issues.

Deliverables:
	•	Comprehensive beta testing report.
	•	A refined version of the Config Tool addressing user feedback and usability concerns.

Milestone 7: Final Release & Documentation

Duration: 1–2 Weeks

Key Tasks:
	•	Documentation Finalization:
	•	Update all documentation, including developer guides, user manuals, and API references.
	•	Code Freeze & Final QA:
	•	Conduct a final round of quality assurance testing.
	•	Prepare release notes and versioning.
	•	Public Release:
	•	Publish the final version on GitHub and deploy the web app to a production environment.
	•	Post-Release Monitoring:
	•	Set up monitoring tools to track performance, usage, and issues post-release.

Deliverables:
	•	Final version of the Config Tool with comprehensive documentation.
	•	Publicly accessible repository and deployed application.
	•	Post-release monitoring and support plan.

Summary & Next Steps
	•	Milestone 1–7 provide a clear roadmap from backend and AI integration through frontend development, deployment automation, security enhancements, beta testing, and final release.
	•	Each milestone includes specific tasks and deliverables that can be tracked via your version control and project management tools (e.g., GitHub Projects or Jira).

Next Immediate Action:
	•	Set up the project repository according to the outlined structure.
	•	Begin work on Milestone 1 by finalizing the backend API and integrating the AI modules.
	•	Assign tasks and set up sprints with clear deadlines.
