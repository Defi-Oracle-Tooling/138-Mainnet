	•	Trigger Terraform commands, capture and return logs.
	•	AI Module Integration:
	•	Develop Python module for cost estimation and risk analysis.
	•	Create /ai-recommendations endpoint to expose AI suggestions.
	•	Logging & Error Handling:
	•	Integrate robust logging (e.g., Winston) for all API actions.
	•	Add global error-handling middleware for consistent error responses.
	•	Testing:
	•	Write and execute unit tests for each endpoint and AI function.
	•	Validate error handling and edge cases.

III. Frontend UI Development (Milestone 2)
	•	Multi-Step Configuration Wizard:
	•	Design and validate UI wireframes for each configuration step:
	•	Environment, deployment type, cloud provider, blockchain options, security, and advanced settings.
	•	Develop individual React components with navigation (forward/backward) and validation.
	•	Drag-and-Drop Logic Builder:
	•	Research and select an appropriate library (e.g., React DnD).
	•	Implement a visual component for composing Boolean logic (AND/OR/NAND/NOR).
	•	Validate user input and transform it into a standard expression.
	•	Live Preview & Dashboard:
	•	Build a live preview panel (JSON/YAML) that updates in real time.
	•	Integrate a cost and risk dashboard fetching AI recommendations from the backend.
	•	API Integration:
	•	Use Axios/Fetch to connect the UI with backend endpoints.
	•	Implement error states and loading indicators.

IV. Infrastructure Deployment Integration (Milestone 3)
	•	Terraform Template Generation:
	•	Expand and refine dynamic Terraform templates to support:
	•	Multi-cloud environments.
	•	Multi-region and conditional resource creation.
	•	Create an API endpoint to return generated Terraform code.
	•	Ansible Playbook Integration:
	•	Develop Ansible playbooks for post-deployment tasks (e.g., Docker installation, configuration updates).
	•	Integrate playbook execution within the deployment workflow.
	•	Staging & End-to-End Testing:
	•	Set up a staging environment that mirrors production.
	•	Execute full end-to-end tests from configuration through deployment.
	•	Validate rollback procedures on deployment failure.

V. CI/CD Pipeline Setup (Milestone 4)
	•	CI/CD Configuration:
	•	Set up pipelines (GitHub Actions/Jenkins) for:
	•	Backend (build, test, deploy).
	•	Frontend (build, deploy).
	•	Configure pipelines to run automated tests and generate deployment artifacts.
	•	Automated Rollback & Monitoring:
	•	Define rollback strategies in the pipeline.
	•	Integrate basic monitoring and alerting (via email/Slack) for deployment issues.
	•	Pipeline Documentation:
	•	Document CI/CD process and rollback procedures.

VI. Security, Compliance & Audit Logging (Milestone 5)
	•	Access Control & Authentication:
	•	Implement RBAC for backend endpoints using JWT or OAuth.
	•	Develop secure login and registration components on the frontend.
	•	Compliance Enforcement:
	•	Develop and integrate scripts to validate configurations against GDPR, FATF, ISO 27001, etc.
	•	Reject non-compliant configurations with actionable error messages.
	•	Audit Logging:
	•	Implement audit logging for configuration changes (user, timestamp, changes).
	•	(Optional) Develop a proof-of-concept for blockchain-based immutable logging.
	•	Security Testing:
	•	Conduct security audits and penetration tests on both API and UI.
	•	Remediate identified vulnerabilities.

VII. Beta Testing & Feedback Integration (Milestone 6)
	•	Beta Deployment:
	•	Deploy a beta version of the complete tool (CLI & Web UI) in a controlled staging environment.
	•	Feedback Collection:
	•	Recruit beta testers and set up feedback channels (surveys, direct feedback forms).
	•	Monitor user analytics and gather qualitative feedback.
	•	Iteration & Refinement:
	•	Prioritize and address critical feedback and bugs.
	•	Plan additional sprints to refine UI/UX, AI recommendations, and integration issues.

VIII. Final Release & Documentation (Milestone 7)
	•	Final QA & Release:
	•	Conduct a final round of comprehensive testing (functional, integration, performance).
	•	Tag the final release version, finalize version numbers, and deploy to production.
	•	Documentation Completion:
	•	Update developer documentation (README, API docs, design docs).
	•	Create user manuals, guides, and tutorials.
	•	Post-Release Monitoring:
	•	Implement monitoring dashboards (Prometheus, Grafana) to track system health.
	•	Establish a support and feedback mechanism for post-release issues.

IX. Final Checks & Project Handoff
	•	Code Review & Merge:
	•	Ensure all code is peer-reviewed and merged according to the branching strategy.
	•	Documentation Review:
	•	Verify that all documentation is complete, clear, and accessible.
	•	Final Demo:
	•	Schedule a demo session to showcase the complete tool.
	•	Project Handoff:
	•	Prepare handoff materials, including deployment guides, maintenance plans, and support contacts.

This punch list serves as a comprehensive guide to ensure that every aspect of the Config Tool project is addressed, from initial setup through final release. It allows for guided flexibility, ensuring that all directions remain within the defined bumpers while providing room for enhancements as needed.
